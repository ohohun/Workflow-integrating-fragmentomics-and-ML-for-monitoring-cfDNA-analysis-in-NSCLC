# Workflow-integrating-fragmentomics-and-ML-for-monitoring-cfDNA-analysis-in-NSCLC
This project aims to develop a non-invasive workflow for monitoring treatment response in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using cfDNA analysis and machine learning, integrating genomic features with clinical data to enable continuous and efficient disease tracking and support precision-based clinical decisions.
